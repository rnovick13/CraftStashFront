This is the README for an application that lets users keep track of all of their craft supplies, pattern information, and projects. Users will be able to update their inventory for a multitude of crafting supplies, have a running index of their patterns, and be able to track their progress on their projects (ranging from gathering materials all the way to completion, including a list of materials needed/already have).

This is the front end, created using JavaScript and React. For the back end, see https://github.com/rnovick13/CraftStashBack

To use, make sure your back end is running and then use npm start.
